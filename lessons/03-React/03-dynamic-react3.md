# Dynamic React, Pt 3
###Learning Objectives
 - [ ] Use PropTypes to ensure our components are used correctly
 - [ ] Use function composition to simplify complex behavior
 - [ ] Create layers of abstraction to hide and contain complexity

##Step 1. PropTypes
Now that we have a fairly complex application that passes lots of props around, how can we be sure that our application is behaving properly? How can we be sure that the user supplied all the correct props to our components?

###Prop validation using PropTypes
[React gives us numerous ways](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html) to validate that our components are being used correctly. This 'self-testing' is crucial to debugging as your application grows in complexity.

####You Do:





####BONUS: Create a third list to show deleted tasks
  1. reduce the existing column sizes by changing the `article` styles to `col-md-5`
  2. create a new column (copy the existing and change stuff) make this new article style `col-md-2`
  3. Note that ALL your filters now must take into account whether the item is deleted or not.
