# Dynamic React

###Learning Objectives
 - [ ] Design the flow of data in a React application
 - [ ] Investigate when to use state vs. props
 - [ ] Justify storing Objects with keys as state instead of array


##Get organized
_NOTE:_ Before we continue, it will be easier to have three (3) terminal windows open to the same directory. This will allow us to work without swapping tons of windows. It might also be a good idea to open your browser to full-screen on another desktop.

We'll need each one to do the following:
 1. One for our normal terminal window where we can work with git; 
 2. One for `webpack`, which will watch the `src` folder for changes and auto-rebuild our react app. 
 3. One for `nodemon`, which will watch our root folder for changes and auto-restart our node server (the step above usually triggers this step.) 
 
##Step 1: Make it Dynamic
Now that you have the template sliced up into React, we should be able to `npm run rebuild` to rebuild the app.
